# Week 4 Debugging Challenge

Welcome to my SpaceX API data fetch. When you press "Get all rockets", this web app will pull information from SpaceX API and utilize DOM to render it to the page. It will update the following:

* Capsule serial number
* Capsule status
* Capsule launch time

In a separate paragraph tag, it also updates the details of each capsule.

Unfortunately, I got hit in the head and forgot how to program. This is a bug galore. Can you help me in fixing it?

There are approximately ten or so bugs in the entire code. Fix them all.
